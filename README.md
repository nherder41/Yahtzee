# Yahtzee
CS108 Calvin College Final:

This was my first project ever for my first cs course at Calvin College, cs 108, in which we learned Python.
For our final projects we were required to use tkinter, a gui library that comes with python.  
I am a fan of the game Yahtzee so I decided to make it.
