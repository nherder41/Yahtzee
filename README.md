# Yahtzee
CS108 Calvin College Final:

This was my first ever project for my first CS course at Calvin College, CS 108, in which I learned Python.
For my final project I was required to use tkinter, a gui library that comes with python.  
I am a fan of the game Yahtzee so I decided to make it.  Enjoy!
